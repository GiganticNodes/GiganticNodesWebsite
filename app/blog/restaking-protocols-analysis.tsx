      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-8">Understanding the Fundamentals</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Restaking protocols represent a fundamental innovation in blockchain security economics by allowing the same capital to secure multiple services simultaneously. These protocols, with EigenLayer being the pioneering implementation, enable ETH staked in the Ethereum consensus layer to be additionally restaked to secure various actively validated services (AVSs). This effectively creates a marketplace for security, where staked capital can be "rented" to secure new protocols without requiring separate token issuance. The mathematical security model relies on the assumption that rational validators will protect all networks they secure to avoid slashing penalties on their base stake. However, this introduces complex game theory considerations around risk correlation and potential systemic vulnerabilities if validators secure too many services with correlated risks.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-8">Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        As restaking protocols mature, we anticipate a refinement of security models and economic incentive designs. Challenges around governance, capital efficiency, and correlated risk will drive innovations to mitigate potential systemic vulnerabilities while maximizing the benefits of security pooling across networks.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-8">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Restaking represents one of the most significant economic innovations in the blockchain security landscape. By enabling capital to secure multiple services simultaneously, these protocols create new possibilities for both validators and service developers. However, the long-term viability of the model will depend on careful management of systemic risks and continued refinement of incentive structures. Validators exploring this space should conduct thorough risk assessment and develop clear strategies for service selection and operational management.
